# Harvard Meaning & Modality Lab PCIbex Template

A Harvard-themed PCIbex template for linguistic judgement experiments with Prolific that you can import at [PCIbex Farm](https://farm.pcibex.net/). 

Currently supports single Likert scale judgements; styling for slider scales and side-by-side Likert/slider judgements coming soon. 

N.B. styling partially supports mobile phones (better than the plain PCIbex styling) but the font size is still hard to control so encouraging participants to use tablets/laptops/desktop computers is recommended.

**Tutorial coming soon!**
