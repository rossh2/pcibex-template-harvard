<p>
    You are being asked to take part in a research study being done by Hayley Ross, 
    a graduate student at Harvard University, and Kathryn Davidson Zaremba, a professor at Harvard University. 
    It is your choice whether or not to participate in this research.

    If you choose to be in the study, you will complete a questionnaire. 
    This questionnaire will help us learn more about meaning and English sentence structure. 
    The questionnaire will take you around 6-10 minutes to complete. 
    Please complete this questionnaire only if you are fluent in English and English is the first language 
    you learned.

<p>
    If you participate in this study, you will be given an English sentence
    and asked to rate how natural the sentence sounds. 
    There are no foreseeable risks from participating in this study.
