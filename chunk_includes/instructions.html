<p>In each question, you will be given a sentence, and rate how natural it sounds.</p>

<p>The rating scale has five points: 
    &lsquo;<i>very unnatural</i>&rsquo;, 
    &lsquo;<i>somewhat unnatural</i>&rsquo;, 
    &lsquo;<i>unsure</i>&rsquo;, 
    &lsquo;<i>somewhat natural</i>&rsquo;, and 
    &lsquo;<i>very natural</i>&rsquo;.
</p>

<p>
    The answer may seem more obvious for some sentences than for others. 
    Don't worry if you feel uncertain: go with your gut feeling and try your best 
    to capture how you feel about the sentence.

<p>Let's start with some examples.</p>
